It's extremely satisying to hear back from students and see how they apply AI!
This was one of the responses:
```
Just wanted to thank you again for being such a great instructor. You really were there for us the whole time and never made a single lecture boring. You supported us through the powerpoint and I can't thank you enough! You taught me a lot and hopefully I can put that to good use one day.
