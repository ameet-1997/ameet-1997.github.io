I was a teaching assistant for the AI/ML winter school 2022 held at Infosys, Mysuru, India.
The workshop attendees were professors from all over India and from different departments.
The teaching staff included professors from different universities in the US, including Prof. Sanjeev Arora from Princeton, Prof. Sameer Singh from UC Irvine, Prof. Dinesh Jayaraman from UPenn, Prof. Pulkit Agrawal from MIT, and Prof. Deepak Pathak from CMU.
It was really fulfilling to see how curious they were and how willing they were to learn.
