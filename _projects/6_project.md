My labmate Alexander Wetting and I taught a university-wide workshop at Princeton on the inner workings of ChatGPT and how you can use it.
You can find the link to slides <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TTyePrw-p_xxUbi3rbmBI3QQpSsTI1btaQuAUvvNc8w/edit#slide=id.g206fa25c94c_0_24">here</a>.
Feel free to adapt and use it!
