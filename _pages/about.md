I am a computer scientist pursuing my Ph.D. at Princeton University, advised by <a href='https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/'>Dr. Karthik Narasimhan</a>.
<!-- My research interests are broadly in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with special emphasis on sub-topics of AI safety, evaluation of large LMs, data-efficient algorithms, efficient NLP architectures, and multilingual NLP. -->
My research interests are broadly in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with special emphasis on sub-topics of AI safety, data-efficient algorithms, efficient NLP architectures, and multilingual NLP.

I am currently visiting <a href='https://allenai.org'>Allen Institute for AI (AI2)</a> and working with <a href='http://ashwinkalyan.com'>Dr. Ashwin Kalyan</a> as part of the <a href="https://allenai.org/aristo">Aristo team</a>.

I am deeply passionate about teaching and view disseminating knowledge to be as important as the research I do.

Previously, I received my B.Tech from IIT Madras, where I worked on reinforcement learning with <a href='http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/'>Prof. Balaraman Ravindran</a> and on NLP with <a href='http://ashwinkalyan.com'>Prof. Mitesh M. Khapra</a> and <a href='http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~sutanuc/'>Prof. Sutanu Chakraborti</a>.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football (soccer), tennis, and the piano.
