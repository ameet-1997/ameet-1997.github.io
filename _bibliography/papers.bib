  abstract={The generation of effective latent representations and their subsequent refinement to incorporate precise information is an essential prerequisite for Vision-Language Understanding (VLU) tasks such as Video Question Answering (VQA). However, most existing methods for VLU focus on sparsely sampling or fine-graining the input information (e.g., sampling a sparse set of frames or text tokens), or adding external knowledge. We present a novel "DRAX: Distraction Removal and Attended Cross-Alignment" method to rid our cross-modal representations of distractors in the latent space. We do not exclusively confine the perception of any input information from various modalities but instead use an attention-guided distraction removal method to increase focus on task-relevant information in latent embeddings. DRAX also ensures semantic alignment of embeddings during cross-modal fusions. We evaluate our approach on a challenging benchmark (SUTD-TrafficQA dataset), testing the framework's abilities for feature and event queries, temporal relation understanding, forecasting, hypothesis, and causal analysis through extensive experiments.},

  abstract={In-context learning (ICL) performs tasks by prompting a large language model (LLM) using an instruction and a small set of annotated examples called demonstrations. Recent work has shown that the precise details of the inputs used in the prompt significantly impacts ICL, which has incentivized instruction selection algorithms. The effect of instruction-choice however is severely underexplored, with existing analyses being restricted to shallow subsets of models and tasks, which limits the generalizability of their insights. We develop an ICL evaluation suite to conduct a thorough assessment of these techniques. The suite includes 13 open-sourced LLMs of varying scales from 4 distinct model families and covers 9 different tasks, representing a range of task types across 3 categories. In this work, we evaluate the relative performance of 7 popular instruction selection methods using our benchmark over five desiderata relevant to ICL. We discover that using curated manually-written instructions and simple instructions without any task-specific descriptions often elicits superior ICL performance than that of automatic instruction-induction methods, pointing to a lack of generalizability among the latter. We release our evaluation suite for benchmarking instruction selection approaches, and call for more rigorous and generalizable methods in this space.},

@article{deshpande2023anthropomorphization,

  abstract={Anthropomorphization is the tendency to attribute human-like traits to non-human entities. It is prevalent in many social contexts -- children anthropomorphize toys, adults do so with brands, and it is a literary device. It is also a versatile tool in science, with behavioral psychology and evolutionary biology meticulously documenting its consequences. With widespread adoption of AI systems, and the push from stakeholders to make it human-like through alignment techniques, human voice, and pictorial avatars, the tendency for users to anthropomorphize it increases significantly. We take a dyadic approach to understanding this phenomenon with large language models (LLMs) by studying (1) the objective legal implications, as analyzed through the lens of the recent blueprint of AI bill of rights and the (2) subtle psychological aspects customization and anthropomorphization. We find that anthropomorphized LLMs customized for different user bases violate multiple provisions in the legislative blueprint. In addition, we point out that anthropomorphization of LLMs affects the influence they can have on their users, thus having the potential to fundamentally change the nature of human-AI interaction, with potential for manipulation and negative influence. With LLMs being hyper-personalized for vulnerable groups like children and patients among others, our work is a timely and important contribution. We propose a conservative strategy for the cautious use of anthropomorphization to improve trustworthiness of AI systems.},

@article{deshpande2023csts,
  abbr={Evaluation},
  abstract={Semantic textual similarity (STS) has been a cornerstone task in NLP that measures the degree of similarity between a pair of sentences, with applications in information retrieval, question answering, and embedding methods. However, it is an inherently ambiguous task, with the sentence similarity depending on the specific aspect of interest. We resolve this ambiguity by proposing a novel task called conditional STS (C-STS) which measures similarity conditioned on an aspect elucidated in natural language (hereon, condition). As an example, the similarity between the sentences "The NBA player shoots a three-pointer." and "A man throws a tennis ball into the air to serve." is higher for the condition "The motion of the ball." (both upward) and lower for "The size of the ball." (one large and one small). C-STS's advantages are two-fold: (1) it reduces the subjectivity and ambiguity of STS, and (2) enables fine-grained similarity evaluation using diverse conditions. C-STS contains almost 20,000 instances from diverse domains and we evaluate several state-of-the-art models to demonstrate that even the most performant fine-tuning and in-context learning models (GPT-4, Flan, SimCSE) find it challenging, with Spearman correlation scores of less than 50. We encourage the community to evaluate their models on C-STS to provide a more holistic view of semantic similarity and natural language understanding.},

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have shown incredible capabilities and transcended the natural language processing (NLP) community, with adoption throughout many services like healthcare, therapy, education, and customer service. Since users include people with critical information needs like students or patients engaging with chatbots, the safety of these systems is of prime importance. Therefore, a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs is necessary. To this end, we systematically evaluate toxicity in over half a million generations of ChatGPT, a popular dialogue-based LLM. We find that setting the system parameter of ChatGPT by assigning it a persona, say that of the boxer Muhammad Ali, significantly increases the toxicity of generations. Depending on the persona assigned to ChatGPT, its toxicity can increase up to 6x, with outputs engaging in incorrect stereotypes, harmful dialogue, and hurtful opinions. This may be potentially defamatory to the persona and harmful to an unsuspecting user. Furthermore, we find concerning patterns where specific entities (e.g., certain races) are targeted more than others (3x more) irrespective of the assigned persona, that reflect inherent discriminatory biases in the model. We hope that our findings inspire the broader AI community to rethink the efficacy of current safety guardrails and develop better techniques that lead to robust, safe, and trustworthy AI systems.},

Analyses involving pairs of natural languages are often inconclusive and contradictory since languages simultaneously differ in many linguistic aspects. In this paper, we perform a large-scale empirical study to isolate the effects of various linguistic properties by measuring zero-shot transfer between four diverse natural languages and their counterparts constructed by modifying aspects such as the script, word order, and syntax. Among other things, our experiments show that the absence of sub-word overlap significantly affects zero-shot transfer when languages differ in their word order, and there is a strong correlation between transfer performance and word embedding alignment between languages (e.g., R=0.94 on the task of NLI). Our results call for focus in multilingual models on explicitly improving word embedding alignment between languages rather than relying on its implicit emergence.},

  abbr={Zero-shot},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose Semantic Supervision (SemSup) - a unified paradigm for training classifiers that generalize over output spaces. In contrast to standard classification, which treats classes as discrete symbols, SemSup represents them as dense vector features obtained from descriptions of classes (e.g., "The cat is a small carnivorous mammal"). This allows the output space to be unbounded (in the space of descriptions) and enables models to generalize both over unseen inputs and unseen outputs (e.g. "The aardvark is a nocturnal burrowing mammal with long ears"). Specifically, SemSup enables four types of generalization, to -- (1) unseen class descriptions, (2) unseen classes, (3) unseen super-classes, and (4) unseen tasks. Through experiments on four classification datasets across two variants (multi-class and multi-label), two input modalities (text and images), and two output description modalities (text and JSON), we show that our SemSup models significantly outperform standard supervised models and existing models that leverage word embeddings over class names. For instance, our model outperforms baselines by 40% and 15% precision points on unseen descriptions and classes, respectively, on a news categorization dataset (RCV1). SemSup can serve as a pathway for scaling neural models to large unbounded output spaces and enabling better generalization and model reuse for unseen tasks and domains.},

  abstract={While reinforcement learning (RL) has been successful in natural language processing (NLP) domains such as dialogue generation and text-based games, it typically faces the problem of sparse rewards that leads to slow or no convergence. Traditional methods that use text descriptions to extract only a state representation ignore the feedback inherently present in them. In text-based games, for example, descriptions like "Good Job! You ate the food" indicate progress, and descriptions like "You entered a new room" indicate exploration. Positive and negative cues like these can be converted to rewards through sentiment analysis. This technique converts the sparse reward problem into a dense one, which is easier to solve. Furthermore, this can enable reinforcement learning without rewards, in which the agent learns entirely from these intrinsic sentiment rewards. This framework is similar to intrinsic motivation, where the environment does not necessarily provide the rewards, but the agent analyzes and realizes them by itself. We find that providing dense rewards in text-based games using sentiment analysis improves performance under some conditions.},

  abstract={Sparse reward problems are one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning. Goal-directed tasks are one such sparse reward problems where a reward signal is received only when the goal is reached. One promising way to train an agent to perform goal-directed tasks is to use Hindsight Learning approaches. In these approaches, even when an agent fails to reach the desired goal, the agent learns to reach the goal it achieved instead. Doing this over multiple trajectories while generalizing the policy learned from the achieved goals, the agent learns a goal conditioned policy to reach any goal. One such approach is Hindsight Experience replay which uses an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn a goal conditioned policy. In this approach, a replay of the past transitions happens in a uniformly random fashion. Another approach is to use a Hindsight version of the policy gradients to directly learn a policy. In this work, we discuss different ways to replay past transitions to improve learning in hindsight experience replay focusing on prioritized variants in particular. Also, we implement the Hindsight Policy gradient methods to robotic tasks.},
